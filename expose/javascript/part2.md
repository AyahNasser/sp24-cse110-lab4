1- It will print 3 because the length og the array prices is three so i will be three after finishing the for loop.
2- It will print 150 since it was calculated inside the for loop and it will give the final/last calculations for it.
3- it will print 150 as it was calculated inside the for loop.

4- [ 50, 100, 150 ], it will return an array has the following numbers [50, 100, 150] as it is computed in the for loop for each element, then we push into the discouned array.
5- it throws an error since in let decleration the variable can only be accessed within the block it is defined in, so here we are trying to access i outside the for loop block.
6- It throws an error since in let decleration the variable can only be accessed within the block it is defined in, so here we are trying to access discountPrice outside the for loop block.
7- It will print 150, this one will not throw an error because we are accessing the variable in the same scope it was defined which is inside the function discountPrices
8- [ 50, 100, 150 ], it will return an array has the following numbers [50, 100, 150] as it is computed in the for loop for each element, then we push into the discouned array.

9- It throws an error since in let decleration the variable can only be accessed within the block it is defined in, so here we are trying to access i outside the for loop block.



10- It will print 3 because the length og the array prices is three and it is a constant and that is the value we gave at the start of the code. 
11- [ 50, 100, 150 ], it will return an array has the following numbers [50, 100, 150] as it is computed in the for loop for each element, then we push into the discouned array.


12- 
A. console.log(student.name);
B. console.log(student['Grad Year']);
C. console.log(student.greeting());
D. console.log(student['Fav Teacher'].name);
E. console.log(student.courseLoad[0]);


13- 
A.'32' integers map to their exact string representation, here it treated the two numbers as string.
B. 1, the 3 string here maps to it is exact number the JS subtracts 2 from 3 resulting in 1, and JS here converted here to an operation to perfom between the two number
C. 3, the null here becomes zero and JS will add 0 to 3 
D.'3null', JS here concatenates the number 3 here which maps to its exact string representation, and null string. 
E. 4, true here maps to 1 and we have the integer 3 so JS adds 1+3=4.
F.0, false and null both here becomes zeros so 0+0 =0 
G.'3undefined', JS here concatenates the number 3 and undefined string. 
H.NaN, JS converted 3 to a number but could not subtract undefined from it since undefined is NaN in JS and it does not map to a number, so the output is NaN. 

14- 
A. true, JS compares the two strings here 2 and 1. Which is true the string 2 is larger than string 1 
B. false, JS compares the two strings here 2 and 12. Which is false the string 2 is not smaller than string 1
C. true, JS converts the '2' to its number then it compares the 2 with the 2 which is true they are equal to each other.
D. false, false because here JS checks for the type and the value and here they are not the same type one is an integer and the other is string, so false. 
E. false, trie is conevrted to 1 then compared to the integer 2, so false they are not equal to each other. 
F. true, the boolean part converts the value 2 to true then it is compared to true so final outout it is true. 

15- (===) as mentioned before compare the data type and the value of the operands, while the (==) apply the type conversion before it compares the operands.



17- The result will be the newArr computed that has the following integers [2,4,6]. We start by passing the array [1,2,3] and the doSomething function to the modifyArray function. Starting with initializing a new array in modifyArray function called NewArr. Then we go through a for loop that will take each element in the array we passed earlier and pass it to the doSomething function and it will multiply the element passed by 2. Finally, we end up with the following newArr = [2,4,6].


19- Output is 1,4,3,2
