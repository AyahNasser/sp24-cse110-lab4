1- It will print 3 because the length og the array prices is three so i will be three after finishing the for loop.
2- It will print 150 since it was calculated inside the for loop and it will give the final/last calculations for it.
3- it will print 150 as it was calculated inside the for loop.

4- It will return nothing because [not sure why]
5- it throws an error since in let decleration the variable can only be accessed within the block it is defined in, so here we are trying to access i outside the for loop block.
6- It throws an error since in let decleration the variable can only be accessed within the block it is defined in, so here we are trying to access discountPrice outside the for loop block.
7- It will print 150, this one will not throw an error because we are accessing the variable in the same scope it was defined which is inside the function discountPrices
8- Print nothing again and not sure why 
9- It throws an error since in let decleration the variable can only be accessed within the block it is defined in, so here we are trying to access i outside the for loop block.
10- It will print 3 because the length og the array prices is three and it is a constant and that is the value we gave at the start of the code. 
11- it will return nothing since the discounted array is empty, and it constnt so even when we push something it will not change its value. 


12- 
A. console.log(student.name);
B. console.log(student['Grad Year']);
C. console.log(student.greeting());
D. console.log(student['Fav Teacher'].name);
E. console.log(student.courseLoad[0]);


13- 
A.'32' integers map to their exact string representation, here it treated the two numbers as string.
B. 1, the 3 string here maps to it is exact number the JS substacts 2 from 3 resulting in 1, and JS here converted here to an operation to perfome between the two number
C. 3, the null here becomes zero and JS will add 0 to 3 
D.'3null', JS here concatenate the number 3 here which maps to its exact string representation, and null string. 
E. 4, true here maps to 1 and we have the integer 3 so JS adds 1+3=4.
F.0, false and null both here becomes zeros so 0+0 =0 
G.'3undefined', JS here concatenate the number 3 and undefined string. 
H.NaN
